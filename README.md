# sudoku-1440

This is an interactive sudoku creating/solving GUI in 1440p created in python with Tkinter.

Resolution scaling has been implemented, but it is a work in progress.

It can solve puzzles you input and create its own puzzles for you to solve.

## dependencies

Numpy: Puzzles are internally represented as numpy arrays.

Pandas: Reuqired in order to read from the "puzzles.csv file."

## usage

Once you have installed the dependancies and downloaded the source code, simply run python3 main.py in a terminal within the code's folder and the gui will pop up. You can also run speedtest.py to test the speed of the solver.
