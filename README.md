## sudoku-1440

This is an interactive sudoku creating/solving GUI in 1440p created in python with Tkinter.

Resolution scaling has been implemented, but it is untested and almost certainly broken.

It can solve puzzles you input and create its own puzzles for you to solve.

# dependencies

Numpy: Puzzles are internally represented as numpy arrays.

Pandas: Reuqired in order to read from the "puzzles.csv file."

# Usage

Once you have installed the dependancies, simply run main.py with python and the gui will pop up. You can run speedtest.py in the terminal to test the speed of the solver.
